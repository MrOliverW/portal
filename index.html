       <p>Hello and welcome, thank you for being here today! "My" name is Oliver Warlick.</p>
       
       <p>I first heard about the YearUp program from a friend of mine who is a software developer. </p>
              
       <p>I built my first website using GoDaddy.com about 5 years ago; a while back I decided to add some HTML to my website and learned that GoDaddy only allows limited site customization.</p>
           
      <p>I wanted more room for creativity with my web design so I switched to WordPress; an open source platform and from there quickly learned just how much there is to learn about web development. YearUp offered the opportunity to learn and earn and that is how I got here.</p>

    <p> I entered the YearUp program with a unique range of skills that I acquired through my work and life experience. I can honestly say that most of my skills have proven useful already in my journey at YearUp (they haven’t asked me to cook anything yet). Having previous technical experience can be a huge benefit in the program but it’s not the end of the world if you don’t have any technical experience. A good attitude and an openness to learning really goes a long way at YearUp. Soft skills also play a huge role in the program and in the workplace. YearUp does a wonderful job of getting students up to speed on professional expectations in a really motivating way. The expectations of corporate America are high and so having a solid grasp on the technical and the soft skills can give us an edge in a competitive job market.
